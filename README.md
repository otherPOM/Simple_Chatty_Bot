# Simple Chatty Bot https://hyperskill.org/projects/113

## Stage 1
For the first stage, you will write a bot that displays a greeting, its name, and the date of its creation. First impressions count!

Your program should print the following lines:
```
Hello! My name is {botName}.
I was created in {birthYear}.
```
Instead of `{botName}`, print any name you choose and replace `{birthYear}` with the current year (four digits).

## Stage 2
In this stage, you will introduce yourself to the bot so that it can greet you by your name.

Your program should print the following lines:

```
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
Please, remind me your name.
What a great name you have, {yourName}!
```

You may change the name and the creation year of your bot if you want.

Instead of `{yourName}`, the bot must print your name entered from the standard input.
