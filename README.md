# Simple Chatty Bot https://hyperskill.org/projects/113

## Stage 1
For the first stage, you will write a bot that displays a greeting, its name, and the date of its creation. First impressions count!

Your program should print the following lines:
```
Hello! My name is {botName}.
I was created in {birthYear}.
```
Instead of `{botName}`, print any name you choose and replace `{birthYear}` with the current year (four digits).
